# Generates a random key as a string of size 1 to maxKeySize
# bytes with values of minByte to maxByte, inclusive, and
# with equal probability for all possible keys.
# Note that with a large number of possible keys, approximately
# pow(1 + maxByte - minByte, maxKeySize), the limits of float precision
# results in all keys being maxKeySize in length. This is the case, for
# instance, with byte values of 0 to 255 and max key sizes of 128 or
# larger.
# Defaults are for common Kinetic keys.
# Notes on the distribution of keys by size:
# For a number of values per byte, v, v = 1 + maxByte - minByte,
#     and a number of keys, x, x = maxKeySize,
# the number of keys by size, k, is
#     v^k / totalKeys
# where totalKeys is v + v^2 + v^3 + ... + v^x.
# A list of the probabilities of keys by key size is
#     size  probability
#     1      v  / (v + v^2 + v^3 + ... + v^x)
#     2     v^2 / (v + v^2 + v^3 + ... + v^x)
#     3     v^3 / (v + v^2 + v^3 + ... + v^x)
#     ...   ...
#     n     v^n / (v + v^2 + v^3 + ... + v^x)
#     ...   ...
#     x     v^x / (v + v^2 + v^3 + ... + v^x)
# These are very large, difficult to calculate numbers when v^x is large
# compared to 1/epsilon.
# An approximation for the likelihood of a key of size k is
#     (v / (v + 1))^(1 + x - k)
# A list of these approximate probabilities of keys by key size is
#     size  probability
#     1     (v / (v + 1))^x
#     2     (v / (v + 1))^(x - 1)
#     3     (v / (v + 1))^(x - 3)
#     ...   ...
#     n     (v / (v + 1))^(1 + x - n)
#     ...
#     x      v / (v + 1)
# Note that in this approximation, many of the smaller probabilities will be
# zero in this program and other limited-precision calculations.
